# How to run
## 1. Get Linux
get linux, either WSL (Windows) or Termux (Android) works fine
## 2. Install packages
install python and... uh i forgot. ts script was 7 months ago. maybe ask gemini to get instructions
## 3. Edit the variables
get Nano for your Linux, edit some variables to your preferences (i suppose even a vibe-coder know where to edit). remember to edit the topic name (note this down)
## 4. Get ntfy.sh
download ntfy.sh to your phone, and/or go to ntfy.sh on your desktop
## 5. Subcribe to the topic
copy the topic you noted down earlier, then subcribe to it
## 6. Run the script
i remember it is `python script.py` isnt it?
# How to circumvent ntfy.sh quota
i estimated that you may exhaute your quota on sending notifs
don't worry, just route your server's internet connection through tor network

tor network always reset your ip every 15 minutes, so do your quota!
